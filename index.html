            <p>Sebastian Stan is a Romanian-American Television and Movie actor. He was born in Constanta, Romania, but moved to 
                Vienna, Austria with his mother when he was eight years old after the Romanian Revolution. When he was twelve years old, 
                they moved to Rockland County, New York, where his mother remarried.</p>
